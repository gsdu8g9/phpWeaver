# phpWeaver

##Description

phpWeaver is a concept on how to run PHP code in a multi threaded environment without any changes to your php code.

##Vision

I think this is going to turn into a module that runs with any PHP application that can run inside VM, like HHVM for example, will see how it turns out to be.

##Todo

* Design Weaver Engine Architecture
* Build Proof of Concept
* Design PHP Weaver Module
* Build PHP APIs
